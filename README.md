# Bus√£o Escolar (School Bus) - Daily College Travel Registration System

This is a project for a registration system for daily bus trips to college. Students can register, indicate the days of the week they will need a reserved seat, and request seats on specific days. The entire system is managed by the administrator, who has control over student attendance, approval of registrations and extra seat requests, and the ability to print the monthly travel list and manage the days the bus will travel.
